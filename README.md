Recurrent Neural Network
<h4>Now we know how basic sentiment analysis works. In this project we learned how to create a RNN using TensorFlow, how to do embedding and padding and how to use LSTM in a real life problem. We also saw how binary and multi-class classification differentiate in practice. This means we have taken our first step towards one of the major artificial intelligence topics: natural language processing.<h4>
